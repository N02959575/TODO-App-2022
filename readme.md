# Introduction

## Mario

- Graduated from SUNY New Paltz spring 2018 with a bachelors in computer science. During my time as an undergraduate I did many simple projects. One was a self watering plant system I did with 2 other students. We made a simple web app to control it. My job during the project was to capture humidity measurements and display them on the web app as they were taken. Another project I did was in my projects class along with another student. We did a program that read book tags from the library. We used python and opencv to do this. My role during that project was to identify a tag, read it and write the text on said tag. After graduating I started working at a security company. They did alarm systems, fire systems, security cameras, networking, POS and ip phones. During that time I learned the basics of creating a network, configuring routers, programming fire systems and alarm systems. I also programmed a few ip phones.
- I am still looking for something in the field of computer science that interests me. That is why I am back doing a masters to see if I can find something that will catch my interest. I like smart devices a lot. I have many in my house. I would like to make a web app to control other similar devices just to learn how everything communicates with each other. I'm hoping this class will at least help me get started in the right direction
